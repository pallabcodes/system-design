# Shopify Scale: Multi-Tenancy for Flash Sales

> **Source**: [Shopify's Multi-Tenant Architecture](https://youtu.be/QvpZc2x8Pvw)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Challenge**: Handling "Flash Sales" (e.g., Kylie Jenner drops) where traffic spikes from zero to millions in seconds. Traditional auto-scaling is too slow. Shopify solves this with **Podding**, **Floating Capacity**, and **BGP Anycast**.

## 🏗️ The Multi-Tenancy Spectrum: Podding

Shopify moved from "Share Everything" to massive "Podding".

```mermaid

    subgraph "Global Load Balancer"
        LB[Nginx + OpenResty]
        SH[Sorting Hat (Lua)]
        LB --> SH
    end

    subgraph "Pod 1 (Isolated)"
        P1_WEB[Web Servers]
        P1_Job[Job Workers]
        P1_DB[(Shard 1)]
    end

    subgraph "Pod 2 (Isolated)"
        P2_WEB[Web Servers]
        P2_Job[Job Workers]
        P2_DB[(Shard 2)]
    end

    subgraph "Floating Capacity (Shared)"
        FC[Spare Web Servers]
    end

    SH -->|Standard Traffic| P1_WEB
    SH -->|Standard Traffic| P2_WEB
    
    SH -.->|Flash Sale!| FC
    FC -->|Assigned Temporarily| P1_DB
```

| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Shopify's Choice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share Nothing** (Magento) | High isolation | Low utilization, expensive | ❌ |
| **Share Everything** | High utilization | Cascading failures, "noisy neighbors" | ❌ (Legacy) |
| **Podding** | Isolation + Utilization | Complex routing (Sorting Hat) | ✅ **Current** |

### The "Floating Capacity" Concept
*   **Pods** have fixed capacity for normal traffic.
*   **Floating Capacity** is a massive shared pool of web servers.
*   When a flash sale hits Pod 1, Sorting Hat dynamically routes extra capacity to Pod 1's database.

## 🎩 "Sorting Hat": The Routing Layer

To route requests to the correct pod (Shard), Shopify built an intelligent routing layer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Nginx as Nginx (OpenResty)
    participant Lua as Lua Application
    participant Redis as Redis/MySQL Cache
    participant Pod as Target Pod

    User->>Nginx: Request (shop.com)
    Nginx->>Lua: "Sorting Hat"
    Lua->>Redis: Lookup Pod for shop.com
    Redis-->>Lua: Returns "Pod-42"
    Lua->>Nginx: Set Upstream: Pod-42
    Nginx->>Pod: Forward Request
    Note over Nginx: Zero-latency overhead<br/>via LuaJIT
```

### Components
*   **Nginx + OpenResty**: The foundation.
*   **Lua Scripts**: Custom logic to routing, logging, and SSL termination.
*   **Performance**: LuaJIT is so fast that routing latency is negligible.
*   **Safety**: If Nginx crashes, it withdraws its BGP route instantly.

## 🌍 Network Scaling: BGP Anycast

DNS failover was too slow (TTL caching). Shopify moved to **BGP Anycast**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Internet"
        User[User Request]
    end

    subgraph "PoP 1 (Chicago)"
        R1[Router]
        LB1[Load Balancer]
        User -->|Shortest Path| R1
    end

    subgraph "PoP 2 (Dallas)"
        R2[Router]
        LB2[Load Balancer]
        User -.->|Failover Path| R2
    end

    subgraph "Data Center (Ashburn)"
        DC_LB[Pod Infrastructure]
    end

    R1 -->|Direct Fiber| DC_LB
    R2 -->|Direct Fiber| DC_LB

    classDef failover fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
```

### Key Network Decisions
1.  **Own Your IPs**: Rented IPs belong to the data center. Owned IPs move with you.
2.  **BGP Anycast**: Announce the *same IP* from all locations. Traffic flows to the nearest PoP.
3.  **Direct Fiber**: If traffic hits the "wrong" DC during failover, tunnel it over private fiber (not public internet) to the correct DC.
4.  **ECMP (Equal Cost Multipath)**: Consistent hashing distributes TCP flows across load balancers.

## 🚦 Automated Failover

| Metric | Manual Failover | Automated Failover |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Team Size** | 10 people | 0 people (Script) |
| **Duration** | Hours/Days | < 5 Minutes |
| **Downtime** | Significant | Zero storefront downtime |
| **Mechanism** | Human coordination | MySQL Replication + Script |

## ✅ Principal Architect Checklist

1.  **Don't Rely on Auto-Scaling for Flash Sales**: By the time VMs boot, the sale is over. Use **Floating Capacity** (over-provisioned pool) instead.
2.  **Move Routing to the Edge**: Use OpenResty/Lua (like "Sorting Hat") to route efficiently before hitting app servers.
3.  **Own Your IP Space**: Cloud provider IPs lock you in. BYOIP with BGP enables global traffic shifting.
4.  **Avoid DNS Failover**: TTL caching kills RTO. Use BGP for instant traffic redirection.
5.  **Isolate Tenants into Pods**: "Share Everything" breaks at scale. "Share Nothing" is too expensive. Pods are the sweet spot.
6.  **Script Your Failover**: If failover requires a "war room", you aren't resilient. It must be a script effectively running under 5 minutes.

## 📖 Analogy: City Utility & The Floating Reservoir

> [!TIP]
> Architecture for Flash Sales:
>
> *   **Share Everything**: One giant water main for the city. If a factory (Kylie Jenner) opens a hydrant, pressure drops for everyone.
> *   **Pods**: Distinct neighborhoods with their own water towers.
> *   **Floating Capacity**: A massive **"Floating Reservoir"** on standby. When a neighborhood hosts a festival (Flash Sale), the city instantly pumps this reserve water ONLY to that neighborhood's tower.
> *   **Sorting Hat**: The smart valve system deciding where water goes.

Q: This architecture is from five years ago. Has it changed? Is it still scallable? What would the architecture look like today?

A:
**Has it changed?**
The "Pod" (or Cell-based) architecture with "Anycast" routing is timeless for massive scale SaaS. It prevents "noisy neighbor" problems and limits blast radius.

**Is it scalable?**
**Yes.** This is the gold standard for infinite horizontal scaling. Even AWS and Azure use this internally (Cells/Zones).

**What would the architecture look like today?**
1.  **Service Mesh:** The "Sorting Hat" (OpenResty/Lua) might today be implemented using **Envoy** or a Service Mesh, though Nginx+Lua is still blazing fast.
2.  **Global Database:** Instead of "MySQL Shards" per pod, we might use **CockroachDB** or **Google Spanner** if we wanted a globally consistent view, but for strict tenant isolation (where US data stays in US), the sharded Pod approach is actually *superior* to a global DB for compliance (GDPR/Data Residency).
3.  **Serverless:** For the "Floating Capacity," we might use **AWS Fargate** or **Lambda** to burst instantaneously without managing a pool of idle EC2 instances.
